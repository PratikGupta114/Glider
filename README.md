# Project Glider  
The official github repository for all Glider boards comprising Documentation, Pinouts & Example Sketches for all applications built using Glider boards.

The Glider Project is an initiative by the HyperDrive Community to make robotics accessible to everyone. It provides the necessary electronics for building quality robots and offers open-source code for projects that can be built using this board.

## A yet another Robo board ?

The Glider board solves a very common problem faced in robotics : 

> ***"Building robot boards from scratch"*** 

Although building a Robot board from scratch is fun, however it isn't necessary to **re-invent the wheel**.

Creating a DIY robot board is often tedious, time-consuming and error-prone, and such errors can be costly. Additionally, constructing the electronics for a robot is time-consuming. Even after successfully creating a DIY robot board on a zero-PCB (also known as a vero board), the board may lack sufficient connectivity, required for other projects.

## More about Glider boards 

Glider boards help makers and electronics hobbyists build amazing robots by providing connectivity for mutiple peripherals on a single pcb, such as:

* 2x 12V DC brushed motors (with connectivity for individual encoders for each motor)
Buttons
* 0.96" I2C OLED display
* MPU6050
* Buzzer & WS2812B Neopixels
* UART-based devices like HC-05
* Any 5V I2C-based peripheral
* In addition to providing connectivity with multiple peripherals, Glider boards offer reverse polarity protection at the source and support a wide voltage supply range of 7V to 20V.

Following are the links to the detailed documentation of all the Glider boards developed so far.

## About Hyper Drive Community

Hyper Drive is a community of like-minded robotics enthusiasts who aim to guide and motivate young engineers in building and breaking barriers to create new robots.

We as community organizers, offer guidance in building autonomous bots and resources, such as articles, discussions, and expert mentorship, to those struggling to make their robots work.
HyperDrive\'s philosophy is centered around the idea of technology as a sport .We aim to bring together a diverse community of innovators, engineers, inventors, enthusiasts, and competitors under one roof.

We are passionate about motivating young engineers to create new robots, break through barriers, and strive for excellence in competition.
Join us today and discover the endless possibilities of robotics. 
No prior experience is necessary, and we welcome all levels of enthusiasts who share our commitment to learning and enthusiasm for engineering. HyperDrive is an initiative to provide you with what we never had during our time, 
and we invite you to be part of this exciting journey.
